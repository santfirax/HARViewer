This project is to view HAR.files in a friendly way. My use case is to view files generated by Katalon studio when doing API Automation

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
